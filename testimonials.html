                work out their differences in constructive ways which in the

                weekly Sunday mass. MPC has enriched me with a much deeper
                insight and the goodness of the faith. I’m actually quite
                touched by how the religion encourages and teaches married
                couples to maintain strong and healthy marriages and really
                sticking to each other through good times and bad. It’s really
                not an easy thing to do so especially now in a society where
                divorce rates are rocket high and marriage seems so fragile."

                “I would like to share with you what struck me most about MPC
                having gone through the course. This is related to the common
                saying ‘give a man to fish and you feed him for a day, teach a
                man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’ – we can see MPC as
                a one-off course where we get to discuss different topics as
                they affect our lives at the present, i.e. MPC feeds us for a
                day, our lives together as enriched at the present moment. We
                can also see MPC as a course that has taught us how to
                communicate with each other, such that we will always be able to
                discuss difficult topics at different times in our lives. If we
                do this, our marriage will be enriched for a lifetime.”

                “Having been with Jon for over 7 years now, I did not think that
                there would be things about him that I was not already aware of
                or that there may be issues that we never touched upon or talked
                about but I think MPC debunked that belief of mine. I actually
                went into MPC thinking that it would be a good platform for us
                to be aware of and to learn about the trial and tribulations of
                marriage and being married rather than it being a process of
                learning new things about Jon, about myself through Jon and
                about us as a couple. To illustrate what I mean, one thing that
                struck me deeply was the sharing on what it means to be faithful
                in marriage. Jesus said ‘I have come to give life and to give it
                more abundantly.’ To be faithful in marriage is more than a
                series of DON’Ts and DOs. It means to be LIFE-GIVING. To bring
                my spouse to his full potential.”

                Dear Presenting Couple,<br /><br />
                Thank you for being such great facilitators in the MPC journey,
                you both did more than just going through the couple paks, in
                fact, we were heard and valued even for the slightest issues in
                our relationship. You have created an great atmosphere of
                openness and faith.<br /><br />

                This MPC started 7 weeks before our wedding and this is actually
                the busiest period with rushing all the preparation. That half
                day of weekend actually mean a lot to us but now we know that it
                is all worth it. Honestly speaking, We expected some
                professionals lecturing or counselling us in MPC, we were quite
                shocked to see couples sharing with us at the front of the stage
                about their personal experience and we actually could hardly
                laugh at their jokes. We both left expecting to drag ourselves
                through these 6 weeks course. Not forgetting there were homework
                assigned each week.<br /><br />

                The first group sharing seems weird as we were all strangers but
                the emphasis of keeping the sharing within the group and having
                you both as example to share deeply about your relationship had
                helped us to open up. The couple pak is a great tool to
                understand ourselves, our partner and our relationship. It
                provides us a channel to share, to address issues, to manage
                expectation and to set goals in our relationship. We are kind of
                “forced” to be transparent with one another, “forced” to face up
                with our issues and “forced” to resolve them together. I began
                to understand what this whole thing is about, it is our
                relationship and our marriage so we seriously don’t need experts
                to tell us what are the right things to do or give us the
                winning formula. We are guided to work out our very own “winning
                formula” for our very own relationship and marriage.<br /><br />

                This MPC doesn’t do miracle to any of our relationship but it
                sets the foundation in our marriage. Having emphasize to put God
                in the center of marriage really help us to benchmark what is
                right & wrong and have faith to believe that we could love &
                forgive each other despite of our imperfections. The road ahead
                is still long, challenging and uncertain, we need to constantly
                apply what we had learnt during MPC.<br /><br />

                We thank God for bringing us together!<br />
                We thank God for knowing all the lovely couples through the
                MPC!<br />
                We thank God for marriages!”<br />

                “Dear Presenting Couple,<br /><br />

                We appreciate very much for your patience in instilling the
                necessary mindset to maintain a successful marriage.<br /><br />

                We also found our attitude on attending MPC sessions has
                gradually change from the feeling of obligation towards keen, as
                what was expected by Michael in the first MPC session.<br /><br />

                Throughout the MPC sessions, we gained quite a lot from the
                sharing, such as the importance of understanding and respecting
                our life partner. From the sessions, not everything is new to
                us. For instance, we knew that there is a way to communicate by
                love letter but just we never realize that how important that
                this tool can be used to maintain a good relationship.<br /><br />

                We truly respect you for your strong faith in Catholic and
                Jesus. With your faith, you make us understand better of what is
                a blessed Catholic marriage and the values of a Catholic
                marriage & Sacrament etc. From this understanding, we are more
                convince to live in a catholic family, like raising our child as
                a Catholic, encourage our child to be more involved in church
                activities when he/she grows up.<br /><br />

                Thanks again for your guidance throughout the whole journey of
                MPC.<br /><br />

                Thanks other couples as well for the sharing and accompany
                during the six week sessions.<br /><br />

                Wish you all a blessed marriage.<br /><br />

                Thank you.”

                To Presenting Couple,<br /><br />

                All good things will come to an end, just when we feel that the
                weekly session has just beginning to be part of our life. The 6
                weeks marriage preparation course is swiftly coming to an
                end.<br /><br />

                We knew that we have to attend the MPC in order for us to hold a
                church wedding in Vietnam. Katherine’s mother is a devoted
                catholic and her only wish for both of us is to see our marriage
                being witness under the faith of Catholic Church. We oblige to
                it.<br /><br />

                The course started and weeks passed, we started to sing praises
                to God.<br /><br />

                We had thank God for sending us such wonderful presenters to
                guide us through the 6 weeks program. Catherine and Mike, you
                have uphold your responsibilities to educate us in your best
                efforts gracefully.<br /><br />

                Although all of us barely knew each other or I will say our
                friendship only started for 6 weeks. You have shared so much of
                yourselves truthfully. It is indeed valuable to us. Your
                hospitalities towards us in your home and ensuring we are in
                best comfort, always ensuring there are enough drinks to go
                around and your generosity of sufficient food during our tea
                break. We truly appreciate.<br /><br />

                This lead us to the question in couple pak 3, “when do we feel
                we are closest to God?”, your unselfishness, compassion and love
                toward us make us feel that we are always with God and in the
                arm of his love.<br /><br />

                You have demonstrated to us that the real facts of life and
                marriage in happiness, sorrows and frustrations. You have made
                us realized in depth and understand the importance of seeking a
                balance in life and seeking differences with an open heart.<br /><br />

                The MPC constitutes of substance of Catholicism which are least
                religious as what we expected. The interpretations of the
                teachings serve us as guides into ethical values in our life.<br /><br />

                To all ECs, it’s great to know and went along with all of you
                guys through the MPC course. It’s just a very short time in life
                but we did have a wonderful time together, sharing, praying and
                learning. All the best to us, may God be with you and please
                keep in touch.<br /><br />

                We will like to express our appreciation to the couple who have
                delivered their prayers and encouragement for us. Thank you
                all.<br /><br />

                Lastly, from the bottom of our heart, to Catherine and Mike, our
                teacher, our friends, thank you very much.

                Dear Presenting Couple,<br /><br />

                We felt very meaningful, enjoyable and fruitful to attend MPC,
                to our surprise, it was much different from our imagination
                about MPC.<br /><br />

                Before we started MPC, we felt that it is a ‘must’ to us to
                attend as required by our church. But as the weeks went by, we
                felt that we are so blessed to have this chance to attend and
                know more about MPC.<br /><br />

                At first we thought that it will be conducted in the formal
                lecture course, which only listen without any participation (one
                way communication). But during the sessions, we are not only
                sharing our feelings among couples, we are also learning from
                our parenting couple (two way communications). It helps us know
                more about our personality and real thinking. It is very useful
                for our future planning for our marriage. And it serves the
                purpose of MPC, which encourage us to focus more on our
                MARRIAGE, but not our WEDDING.<br /><br />

                Besides, we would like to take this opportunity to say thank you
                to both of you. We sincerely appreciate for your willingness to
                spend extra time for our separate session as we were not able to
                attend the group session due to the funeral of our beloved aunt
                in Malaysia.<br /><br />

                We will definitely encourage our wed-to-be friends to attend MPC
                because this is the only time that the couple will know more
                about themselves before wedding.<br /><br />

                God bless!”
