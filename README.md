# Prototyping

## Prototyping was done using Adobe XD
- Wire-frame kit recommended by [Adobe XD Ideas](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-templates-for-ux-designers/) was used
- I chose the [Wires Template](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55462459/Wires-wireframe-kits-for-Adobe-XD) as a base to do my UI prototyping. 
- Credits to the creators of Wires: [Kyle Galle](https://www.behance.net/kgalle_adobe), [UI8](https://www.behance.net/ui8), and [Jonathan Pimento](https://www.behance.net/jonathanpimento)
