- Existing non-responsive **[MPC Singapore Website](https://www.mpcsingapore.com/)**

**[Re-worked MPC Singapore Website](https://malrhis.github.io/Project-1-codeinstitute/index.html)**

# Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4

# User Story or (JTBD) Jobs-to-be-Done
1. As a user I would like to find out about what MPC is about easily when I land on the homepage
2. As a user I would like to know what's the schedule of MPC
3. As a user I would like to be able to sign up for MPC if I feel that it suits me
4. As a user I would like to know more about the people running the course
5. As a user I would like to know how other people felt about the course after they attended it
6. I would like to be able to access this information on the go

# Key Features
The user stories show that most users require an information repository laid out to them in an easily digestible manner, something which modern web design can handle via technologies like **Bootstrap 4**. 

The key difference between the old website and the one I am putting together is the mobile responsiveness of the website, as well as the 

1. Navigation Bar Spanning all pages
2. Mobile Responsiveness
3. Impactful homepage with CTA to redirect users to other parts of the site
4. Other pages to accomodate information listed in User Story / JTBD section

# Prototyping

## Prototyping was done using Adobe XD
- Wire-frame kit recommended by [Adobe XD Ideas](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-templates-for-ux-designers/) was used
- I chose the [Wires Template](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55462459/Wires-wireframe-kits-for-Adobe-XD) as a base to do my UI prototyping. 
- Credits to the creators of Wires: [Kyle Galle](https://www.behance.net/kgalle_adobe), [UI8](https://www.behance.net/ui8), and [Jonathan Pimento](https://www.behance.net/jonathanpimento)

## Prototyping Ideation
MPC Singpore's existing website had an outdated UI, but was clearly separated into a few sections
1. Homepage
2. Course Application
3. FAQ
4. Testimonies
5. About Us
6. Miscellaneous information such as Contacts, related websites

For the purpose of this project, I grouped items into a few key pages.
The below table lists these pages and their mockups
